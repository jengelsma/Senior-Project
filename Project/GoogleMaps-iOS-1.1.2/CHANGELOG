==========================
Features:

    info window.

Version 1.1.0 - February 2013
=============================
Features:
  ! The points of a GMSPolyline (and GMSPolylineOptions) are now specified as
    a GMSPath and built via a GMSMutablePath, rather than addVertex: etc
  - GMSPolyline may now be specified as geodesic
  - animateToCameraPosition: method on GMSMapView
  - GMSProjection provides containsCoordinate: and visibleRegion helpers

Resolved Issues:
  - GMSCameraPosition and animateToLocation: now clamp/wrap latitude/longitude
    respectively; similarly, bearing is clamped to 0 <= bearing < 360
  - GMSGroundOverlay may be modified after creation
  - The points of a GMSPoyline may be modified after creation
  - GMSPolyline may cross the antimeridian
  - Resolved a marker sorting issue
