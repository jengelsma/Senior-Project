		<string>Peter C. Cook established Mazda Great Lakes, the first and only independent direct distributorship in the U.S. until Mazda bought it back. In addition to his business ventures, he enjoyed playing the trumpet, and had a love for Dixie bands. Peter was inducted into the Grand Valley Hall of Fame in honor of his many contributions to the growth of the university. He believed strongly in giving back to his community stating that, “There are two necessary things in giving: one is to be willing, the other is to be able. Able is secondary because many people who are not willing to do become able but still never give. People who have little yet give what they can become the big givers because they are able. That’s because they had always been willing.” </string>

		<string>L. William “Bill” Seidman formed the Committee to Establish a Four-Year College, which would become the first step in the foundation of Grand Valley State University. For the next two years, Bill and his wife Sally hosted meetings and parties in their home and across Western Michigan, asking friends and community leaders to get involved and make this vision a reality. In 1960, Grand Valley’s charter was signed by the State of Michigan and Bill’s “high hopes” were fulfilled. Bill and Sally remained an integral part of the Grand Valley family for the duration of their lives. Bill Seidman‘s leadership extended far beyond Western Michigan. He served as an adviser to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, and later headed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  He and Sally founded The Washington Campus in Washington, D.C., a consortium of business schools across the country dedicated to educating business leaders on the public policy process.  In his later years, he became the Chief Financial Commentator for the CNBC business cable network, and continued to advise businesses and governments throughout the world. Even with all of these extraordinary life accomplishments, Bill Seidman often stated that the founding of Grand Valley State University was his proudest achievement.</string>

		<string>Russel H. Kirkhof was known as Grand Rapids&apos; electronic genius, inventor and businessman. His father passed away when he was just ten years of age, and Kirkhof left school after the 7th grade to work for the Lewis Electric Company. After several positions and a stint in the army doing electrical work on airplanes in France, Kirhof came home to work for his old employer Lewis Electrical Company. In 1925, he opened his own electrical shop in Grand Rapids, and landed contracts with Consumers Power and GM. Due to a friendship with John Scherff, who tended the grounds at his home and eventually became employed with Grand Valley State Colleges, Kirkhof gifted the college one million dollars and his home upon his death. </string>

		<string>Arend (Don) Lubbers was Grand Valley State University’s highly celebrated president from its youth in 1968 to its modern image in 2001. After receiving his Bachelor Degree from Hope College and Masters from Rutgers University, Don taught at Wittenberg College in Ohio and then returned to Rutgers in 1958 to pursue a doctorate. In 1960 he was appointed president of Central College in Pella, Iowa at the age of 29, becoming the youngest college president in the nation. Two years later, the young academic attracted national attention when Life magazine included him in its &quot;Red-Hot Hundred,&quot; profiling 100 outstanding American leaders under 40. Don was still among the youngest college presidents in the nation when he assumed the Presidency at Grand Valley in January 1969. During his tenure, Grand Valley saw the construction of academic buildings and residence halls in Allendale; the Meijer Campus in Holland, and the Eberhard Center and Richard M. DeVos Center in Grand Rapids. The university also extended its service with programs in Muskegon and Traverse City in cooperation with local community colleges. Don led efforts to establish the Seidman College of Business, the Kirkhof College of Nursing, and the Schools of Education, Social Work, Health Sciences, Engineering, and Communication. Also during his tenure, GVSU’s programs in music, art, chemistry, education, social work, business, and nursing have earned professional accreditations. When Don retired in 2001, he was the longest-serving public university president in the country.</string>

		<string>L. William “Bill” Seidman formed the Committee to Establish a Four-Year College, which would become the first step in the foundation of Grand Valley State University. For the next two years, Bill and his wife Sally hosted meetings and parties in their home and across Western Michigan, asking friends and community leaders to get involved and make this vision a reality. In 1960, Grand Valley’s charter was signed by the State of Michigan and Bill’s “high hopes” were fulfilled. Bill and Sally remained an integral part of the Grand Valley family for the duration of their lives. Bill Seidman‘s leadership extended far beyond Western Michigan. He served as an adviser to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, and later headed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  He and Sally founded The Washington Campus in Washington, D.C., a consortium of business schools across the country dedicated to educating business leaders on the public policy process.  In his later years, he became the Chief Financial Commentator for the CNBC business cable network, and continued to advise businesses and governments throughout the world. Even with all of these extraordinary life accomplishments, Bill Seidman often stated that the founding of Grand Valley State University was his proudest achievement.</string>
